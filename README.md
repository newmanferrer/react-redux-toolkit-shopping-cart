# REACT REDUX TOOLKIT SHOPPING CART

Practice on the use of the Redux Toolkit. Redux Toolkit includes a set of tools for efficient Redux development. It includes utilities to simplify common use cases such as store setup, reducer creation, immutable update logic, and more.

## Project description

In this project we will build an application that simulates a shopping cart which we can compare with the one we built earlier using only Redux, here is the link to the repository: https://github.com/newmanferrer/react-redux-shopping-cart

I also leave below a link to another of my projects where I only use Redux: https://github.com/newmanferrer/react-redux-counter

This will allow us to decide whether it is better for us to manage our states with Redux or by using a tool like the Redux Toolkit.

Our application itself will be very simple, it will allow us to add a product to the cart, show product details, increase or decrease the quantity of the same product, remove it from the cart and finally remove all the products that our shopping cart has (clean the trolley). Our application will manage the quantity of products to control adding products without stock.

The structure of folders and file names are very important to me as they allow me to understand and locate components, hooks, services, etc. faster, I think this takes a lot of time but it helps me. I hope you can understand this structure and if you have suggestions they will be well received as I don't have much experience.

The most important and relevant part of this practice is the management of our global states using the Redux Toolkit, I really hope it will be of great help to you.
